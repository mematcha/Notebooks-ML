Please activate the concerned venv to make sure the code runs correctly.

I have used an environment that uses the following libraries:

- torch (2.0.0)
- torchtext (0.15.0) [Because of this https://github.com/pytorch/text/issues/1928]

> torchtext seems to be not properly maintained, in the sense there are compatibility issues with NumPy and even other modules of pytorch

- torchaudio (2.0.0)
- torchvision (0.15.0)

I expect things to change in the coming months/years to bring compatibility to all modules.

Other libraries I have installed:

- matplotlib (3.9.2)
- torchviz (0.0.2)
